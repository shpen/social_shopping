= Social Shopping

== A Quora/StackOverflow-like community for shopping. See: www.socialshopping.herokuapp.com

This is a project I was working on during the summer of 2015, but eventually scrapped. I didn't realize how frustrating and lonely it can be to work on a project alone, and when I got to the visual design stage, I was unable to come up with anything that satisfied me. Eventualy I lost interest in this project and decided to abandon it. I still believe that it is a viable product and could turn into a successful business. I just don't have the motivation to take it to that level right now.

Feel free to build on this if you're interested, or just rip out parts to use in your own Rails app.
